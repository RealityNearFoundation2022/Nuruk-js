## NEAR Protocol 

NEAR Protocol is a new smart contract platform that offers scalability and ease of use.

Nuruk connects and interacts with the NEAR blockchain
that will allow us to make transactions with the wallet

Through sharding, it will linearly scale with the number of validation nodes on the network.
